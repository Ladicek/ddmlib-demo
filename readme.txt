This is a demo of how to connect to ADB server using ddmlib and enumerate connected Android devices.

If you want to run it, you can easily compile it yourself or you can use Gradle like this:

1. Install Gradle, at least 1.0-milestone-1. See http://www.gradle.org.
2. Run the application with 'gradle run'.

Note that the ADB server should be running. If it isn't, it is detected and the program fails. This is on purpose.
